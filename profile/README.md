## NBN Atlas

![NBN Atlas Open source project hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/.github/assets/57353501/cc4ee7e4-c928-4678-a475-da511d3c15d2)


Take a look at the new open source community mono repo [nbn-project-hub](https://github.com/nbnuk/nbn-project-hub). We currently require React components. 

We also welcome suggestions for other open source projects that could provide both real world developer experience as well as adding value to the NBN Atlas.
